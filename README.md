# CatFish

## Description

CatFish is a game that allows users to catch fish to sell, in order to buy random cat facts. This project was built for entertainment purposes, with the inspiration of a creator that has an interest in Animal Crossing and love for cats. We learned to incorporate HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and third party APIs to create one website.
