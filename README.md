# CatFish

## Description

CatFish is a game that allows users to catch fish to sell, in order to buy random cat facts. This project was built for entertainment purposes, with the inspiration of a creator that has an interest in Animal Crossing and love for cats. We learned to incorporate HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and third party APIs to create one website.

Once sold, the fish will disappear from the inventory and the price will be added to your wallet.

As you buy cat facts, worth $5000, the money will be subtracted from your wallet. If you try to buy a fact when you don't have enough money, you will be met with an angry store cat sales-animal.
